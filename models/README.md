# Trained Models (Not Included)

Trained VAE model checkpoints are not included in this repository due to file size constraints.

All models reported in the paper can be fully reproduced by running the provided training scripts
(e.g., `generate_synthetic_data.py`) starting from the public GEO dataset.

The trained model files will be automatically saved to this directory when the scripts are executed.
